# Endless-Running
This my first project which is an endless running game where players jump over obstacles and collect coins to achieve the highest score possible. Once the game ends, players can view their highest score on a leaderboard, which displays scores from multiple players. Through the PlayFab API, players can also see their current ranking compared to others.
